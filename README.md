Triple Ten CoffeeShop Project!

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. 
It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

What else was used~

W3C Markup/CSS to check my work

MDN Web Docs for more information

Project features~

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

I would try to improve more with the text styling and color decorations.
Maybe could use more animations with the pages.
Add way more vibrant colors to stand out!
